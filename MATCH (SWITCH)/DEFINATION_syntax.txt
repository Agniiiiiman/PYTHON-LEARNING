The Python Match Statement
Instead of writing many if..else statements, you can use the match statement.

The match statement selects one of many code blocks to be executed.

Syntax:
match expression:
  case x:
    code block
  case y:
    code block
  case z:
    code block
This is how it works:

The match expression is evaluated once.
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
