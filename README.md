Overview:-

This project provides a foundational introduction to the Python programming language, focusing on its core concepts, structure, and fundamental working principles.
It is designed to help beginners understand the basic architecture of Python and develop a clear understanding of how the language operates in practical applications.


Prerequisites:-

This project requires Python 3.x to be installed on your system, along with pip (the Python package manager) for dependency management. 
A fundamental understanding of Python programming concepts such as variables, control structures, functions, and object-oriented principles is recommended. 
Any required third-party libraries can be installed using the provided requirements.txt file by executing the command pip install -r requirements.txt. 
For improved dependency isolation and environment management, the use of a virtual environment (e.g., venv) is strongly recommended.

Voice-Controlled Computer Assistant (Python)

This project is a voice-controlled computer assistant built using Python that allows users to control system operations and applications through voice commands. 
The assistant uses speech recognition to interpret user input and execute corresponding system-level actions in real time.

The system can perform tasks such as restarting and shutting down the computer, opening desktop applications like Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, and launching web platforms including YouTube through browser automation. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the practical implementation of voice recognition, system command execution, and automation using Python.

The assistant processes spoken input, converts it into text using speech recognition libraries, and maps commands to predefined system actions. It integrates operating system commands and web browser control to provide a hands-free computing experience.

 Features:

🎤 Voice command recognition

🔁 System restart command

⛔ System shutdown command

📂 Open Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint

🌐 Open web platforms like YouTube

⚡ Real-time command execution

🛠 Technologies Used:-

Python

SpeechRecognition

PyAudio

OS module

Webbrowser module

 Objective

The main objective of this project is to explore automation and voice-based interaction systems using Python.
It demonstrates how voice recognition can be integrated with system-level operations to improve user interaction and productivity.
