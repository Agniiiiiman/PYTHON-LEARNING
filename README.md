Overview:-

This project provides a foundational introduction to the Python programming language, focusing on its core concepts, structure, and fundamental working principles.
It is designed to help beginners understand the basic architecture of Python and develop a clear understanding of how the language operates in practical applications.


Prerequisites:-

This project requires Python 3.x to be installed on your system, along with pip (the Python package manager) for dependency management. 
A fundamental understanding of Python programming concepts such as variables, control structures, functions, and object-oriented principles is recommended. 
Any required third-party libraries can be installed using the provided requirements.txt file by executing the command pip install -r requirements.txt. 
For improved dependency isolation and environment management, the use of a virtual environment (e.g., venv) is strongly recommended.
