Escape Character
To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.

An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.

An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

"""


txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."

print("She said \"Hello!\"")
print('It\'s a beautiful day.')
print("This is a new line\nThis is the next line.")
print("Tab\tseparated\twords")
